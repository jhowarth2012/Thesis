I would like to thank the many staff and students at The University of Manchester, in particular Prof Schwanenberger and Dr Wengler for supervising me, Mark and Pilko for teaching me, and Fred for giving me a chance in the first place.

Also I would like to thank my family who have supported me throughout my education; especially my Parents Kim, Jason and Brian and my grandparents Don, Cynthia and Gladys.

Thanks to everyone on the LTA for making two years at CERN a surreal and life changing experience!

Perhaps most of all I would like to thank Joe. Your love and support was a constant crutch on which I leaned heavily and without which this thesis might never have been written.

And finally, I would like to thank a truly unique group of people. They have never been to CERN or written a piece of code but they taught me how to push through every bad day and appreciate every good one. Only two words could ever be sufficient for you amazing, brilliant, and quite possibly crazy group of travellers:
